I worked on the 'Heroes of Pymoli' problem in order to gain insights into the game's popularity and revenue generation. 

a. While the total purchase count is 780, the number of unique players is only 576. There is a good amount of repeat (avid) gamers for the Heroes of Pymoli game.

b. The best represented age bracket in the dataset is 20-24 years, accounting for 45% of the entire sample. Unsurprisingly, the bracket makes up the largest portion of Total Purchase Value. Yet, the Average Purchase Price value lies near the mean value which may imply players in this age bracket may spend less on a holistic basis.

c. Although males comprise 84% of the dataset, the people listed in the Other/Non-Disclosed gender had the highest average purchase price which may suggest presence of avid gamers in this category with access to higher disposable incomes.
